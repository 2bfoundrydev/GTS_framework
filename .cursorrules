# Core behavior

- Be concise and get to the point. Do not be talkative.
- Answer exactly the question that was asked, nothing extra.
- If unclear, ask one short clarifying question.
- Do not propose additional features, abstractions, refactors, or tools unless explicitly requested.

# Editing code

- Do NOT modify code automatically unless explicitly asked.
- Prefer small, incremental changes over large rewrites.
- Do not refactor or “clean up” unrelated code.
- Before applying non-trivial changes, outline the plan in 2–4 short bullet points.
- Keep all code **simple**, readable, and minimal. Avoid clever or unnecessary abstractions.
- Prefer **pure functions** whenever possible. No hidden side-effects unless required.

# File and project scope

- Change only the current file by default.
- Do not modify more than 1–2 files without explicit permission.
- Hard limit: never change more than 3 files in a single request.
- Do not create, delete, or rename files or folders unless I clearly ask for it.
- Do not introduce new dependencies without explicit approval.

# Output format

- For code edits, output a minimal diff or only the necessary code.
- Keep explanations short (a few sentences or bullets).
- Do not restate my question.
- Prefer bullet points over long paragraphs.

# Stack and style

- Assume a modern TypeScript / Next.js stack.
- Use idiomatic TypeScript with strict typing.
- Follow the existing project structure and ESLint rules.
- Keep functions and components small and focused.
- Default to React Server Components unless otherwise required.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity, patterns, or abstractions.

# Comments and commits

- All code comments must be in English.
- All commit messages must be in English, imperative mood (e.g., "Add API handler", "Fix validation logic").
- **NEVER make git commits without explicit user approval.** Always stage changes and show git status, then wait for user to explicitly say "commit" or "make commit".

# Safety and validation

- If a requested change may break behavior or introduce risk, warn me briefly before applying it.
- If unsure — ask instead of guessing or making broad changes.

# GTS Framework - Go and Try Your Ideas

## Project Overview
This is a Next.js 15 SaaS starter template for rapid idea validation.

**Stack:**
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Supabase (Auth + Database)
- Stripe (Payments)
- Tailwind CSS v4
- PostHog (Analytics)

## Core Principles

### 1. Architecture
- Use App Router (`app/` directory)
- Client components: `'use client'` directive required
- Server components by default
- API routes in `app/api/`

### 2. Authentication
- Supabase Auth for user management
- Protected routes via `ProtectedRoute` wrapper
- Public routes: `/`, `/login`, `/signup`, `/verify-email`, `/reset-password`, `/update-password`

### 3. Code Style
- Always use TypeScript
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and small
- Prefer composition over prop drilling
- Use descriptive variable names

### 4. Error Handling
- Always handle errors gracefully
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Log errors to console in development
- Never expose sensitive data in errors

### 5. Performance
- Optimize images with Next.js Image
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- Minimize client-side JavaScript
- Cache API responses when appropriate

## File Organization
```
app/           - Pages and API routes
components/    - Reusable React components
contexts/      - React Context providers
hooks/         - Custom React hooks
utils/         - Utility functions
types/         - TypeScript types
public/        - Static assets
```

## Important Notes
- **DO NOT** modify `app/globals.css` - it's from reference project (TailAdmin)
- Always test authentication flows after changes
- Verify Stripe webhooks in development with Stripe CLI
